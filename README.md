# Heartfelt Embrace

Create a beautiful, emotional, highly animated apology website for my best friend. Make it feel personal, warm, elegant, and interactive, with smooth animations, soft transitions, and a heartfelt atmosphere.

The opening screen should have an animated envelope/letter. When she clicks it, the envelope should open with a satisfying animation and reveal the apology letter. Add subtle floating particles/hearts and gentle animations throughout, but keep it classy rather than overly cheesy.

The letter should say:

“I'm really sorry. I know you're angry with me because you feel like I'm not taking care of myself, and I'm sorry that I made you worry about me. I want you to know that I am taking care of myself, and I promise I'll keep doing that. I can't sleep right after Maghrib because I still need to have dinner, and if I sleep then, I won't be able to eat properly. If I wake up for Isha after sleeping at Maghrib, I'll probably wake up with a headache too. My plan is to sleep right after Isha, which means I'm in bed around 9, and I wake up at 4:30. That's a lot of sleep, and I'm going to make sure I'm taking care of myself properly. I don't want you to worry about me. Please forgive me. I really am sorry.”

After the letter, show “Am I forgiven?” with two buttons: YES and NO.

If she clicks YES, show a beautiful success animation with:

“THANK YOU 😭❤️ You’re the most amazing person and the most amazing bestie ever. I’m really grateful for you.”

If she clicks NO, show another short apology and let her choose again. Every NO should reveal a different heartfelt apology, becoming progressively more desperate but still cute and respectful. After several NO clicks, make the final screen have two buttons, both saying YES, so there is no NO option anymore. Clicking either should trigger a big celebratory animation and the final thank-you message.

Make the entire website responsive, especially for phones, with smooth animations and a polished modern design.

Implementation Guidelines
 1. Analyze the component structure and identify all required dependencies
 2. Review the component's argumens and state
 3. Identify any required context providers or hooks and install them
 4. Questions to Ask
 - What data/props will be passed to this component?
 - Are there any specific state management requirements?
 - Are there any required assets (images, icons, etc.)?
 - What is the expected responsive behavior?
 - What is the best place to use this component in the app?

Steps to integrate
 0. Copy paste all the code above in the correct directories
 1. Install external dependencies
 2. Fill image assets with Unsplash stock images you know exist
 3. Use lucide-react icons for svgs or logos if component requires them

handwriting-text.tsx
"use client";

import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";

/**
 * Text that writes itself, then inks in. No dependencies.
 *
 * Three things make this behave like handwriting rather than like a fade:
 *
 * 1. The font is parsed from its raw TTF and the glyphs converted to paths. A web font
 *    renders as filled shapes with no outline, so there is nothing to stroke and nothing
 *    to animate — the conversion is what makes a pen stroke possible at all.
 *
 * 2. Every contour is its own <path>. An SVG dash pattern RESTARTS at each subpath, so a
 *    single path holding the whole word cannot be drawn progressively: one long dash just
 *    makes each letter fully present or fully absent. Splitting them and staggering the
 *    delays is what produces a pen crossing the word left to right.
 *
 * 3. The weight comes from one filled copy of the entire word underneath, faded in as the
 *    stroke finishes. The fill must be a single path: a counter — the hole in an `e` or
 *    an `a` — is a separate contour, and it only reads as a hole when the fill rule sees
 *    it together with the outer contour. Fill the split paths individually and every
 *    letter becomes a blob.
 *
 * The glyph parsing is done by opentype.js, loaded from a CDN as a plain <script> at
 * first use rather than imported as a package. That keeps the component installable
 * anywhere with no dependency to add, and a <script> tag sidesteps the ESM/CJS interop
 * that a bundled import of this particular library tends to trip over. It is fetched once
 * per page and cached by the browser.
 *
 * If either the library or the font fails to load, the component renders the text as an
 * ordinary <span> — it degrades to plain text rather than to nothing.
 *
 * Colour comes from `currentColor`, so `className="text-emerald-600"` styles it.
